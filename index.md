# MCB19 [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ZeniteSolar/MCB19?style=flat)](https://github.com/ZeniteSolar/MCB19/blob/master/LICENSE)
The **M**odule for **C**harge **B**atteries 20**19** (portuguese: **M**ódulo para **C**arregamento das **B**aterias 2019) is an *opensource hardware and software* module of the [Zenite Solar Boat](about/) responsible to charge and maintain an auxiliary 12V Lead Acid battery (even when under heavy load), given an input from a main 36V battery pack.

## System highlights:
  - Input voltage range from 20 to 50V (configurable)
  - Output voltage range from 10 to 15V (configurable)
  - Output current limited at 10A (configurable)
  - Input undervoltage protection (configurable)
  - Output overvoltage protection (configurable)
  - Efficiency over 90%
  - CANBUS capable

## Project highlights
  - Full Open Source Software and Hardware (under GPL3)
  - Developed for the **Zênite Solar Boat**
  - Using the popular *ATmega328p*
  - **Digital Control System** simulated using *PSIM*
  - PCB made with *KiCAD*
  - Firmware documented with *Doxygen*
  - Continous Integration set up to build the documentation for both firmware and hardware using Github Actions

## Documentation
  - For more information about this project, see the [About](about/) section.
  - For technical documentation, see the [Firmware](firmware/) and the [Hardware](hardware/) sections.
